->flutter canvas
    -> in normal canvas y is in vertical and x is in x direction (y starts from bottom to top and x starts from left to right)
    -> flutter canvas its filped, y starts from top to bottom and x starts from left to right
    -> z goes towards the screen

    ->angles
        -> normal angles move in anti clock wise 
        -> in fluter angles moves in clock wise
        -> formula to calulate point on circumfernece 
              -> x = r* cos(angle)
              -> y = y * sin(anlge)
        -> pi = 180 degree

    -> animation controller
       -> takes values between 0 and 1 with a duration
    -> animation
       -> mps values in a desired range using animation controller
